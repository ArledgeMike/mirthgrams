<h3>Want to be an admin?</h3>
<p>We always need help adminning the site (yes we have a way of keeping you off the mirthgram if we want) and adding content from @closerlookgrams. Email arledgemike@gmail.com and show some interest if you want to be included.</p>

<h3>Know how to code? Want to help?</h3>
<p>Start up a <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> account, make a pull request, and then send your changes up stream for a merge. Anyone providing working code that gets merged I am buying a beer.</p>

<h3>Got an idea, or art, or some copy?</h3>
<p>I can't think of everything and these three items I find others are really good at. I could really use some help with the copy. Email arledgemike@gmail.com and show some interest if you want to be included. Same rules apply free beer to those that make the merge.</p>
